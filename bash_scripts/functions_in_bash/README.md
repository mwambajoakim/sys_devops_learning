# <ins>Functions in Bash</ins>

## Introduction

- You may find yourself rewriting the same pieces of code again and again in different parts of your bash scripts.

- Luckily, you can avoid rewriting code by using functions in bash which will make your scripts more organized and readable.

- A function has to be called for it to be used.

- A function definition precedes its call in a script.
