# <ins>Strings in Bash</ins>

## Introduction

- Bash does not really have types and things like strings and numbers are just defined in variables.

- In this beginner project, I look at declaration of strings, concatenation, checking the number of characters, changing string to uppercase or lowercase and extracting characters from a string.
