## Introduction
At the time of writing this README, I have some knowledge of Linux and just wanted to expanf=d that knowledge. In this learning project I explore bash scripting.

Bash is one of the most used shells in all Linux distributions and I will learn how to automate tasks and create simple tools by writing scripts that ease up most of my work.
